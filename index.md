Picturo is a simple flat file photo gallery running. No admin, you just need to drop your pictures in the `content` to publish your pictures.
Picturo is heavily inspired by [Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/), but it's for photos.

## Demo

[You can try Picturo here](http://picturo.johanbleuzen.fr), actually the demo is private but you can login with the following credentials :

* user : `admin`
* password : `admin`

## Requirements

To run Picturo you will need **PHP 5.2.4+** and **GD Library** on your server. If you're running Apache you will also require `mod_rewrite` to be enabled.

## Installation

1. First [download Picturo ](https://github.com/jbleuzen/Picturo/zipball/master) and extract it on your server.
2. Change ownership and permission of the `cache` folder to the user of your web server set permissions to 777 so you'll be able to delete cache if needed.
3. [Install composer](http://getcomposer.org/) if needed and install the dependencies (`php composer.phar install` or `composer install`)
4. Upload your folders of pictures into `content`.
5. Customize settings by editing `config.php` in the root folder of Picturo. To override a setting simply uncomment it in `config.php` and set your custom value.

## Privatize your site

Picturo can keep your galleries private, you just have to edit `config.php` and set `private` variable to true and add a user. By default, there is an admin user with the password "admin" in the configuration file. Just uncomment the two following lines to enable private galleries :

{% highlight php %}
$config['private'] = true;
$config['private_pass']['admin'] = 'd033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997';
{% endhighlight %}

Passwords are SHA-1 strings, you can generate your passwords online [here](http://www.sha1-online.com/).

## Add galleries

Your photos must be stored in `content` folder, if you want to add a gallery you just need to create a folder within your `content` folder.

Galleries thumbnail are generated with the first picture found in the folder.

## Create your own theme

Picturo supports themes with [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as templating engine they are located in the `themes` folder.

All themes must include two files :

 * gallery.html
 * detail.html

If you want to keep your [galleries private](/#privatize_your_site), you will need a third file "login.html".

Each file will have a basic set of variable, plus specific variable.

Default variables, available for all files :

 * \{\{ base_url \}\} : The URL of your site
 * \{\{ theme_url \}\} : The URL of your active theme
 * \{\{ site_title \}\} : The title of your website
 * \{\{ username \}\} : The logged in username (if you use private gallery)

Variables for `gallery.html`, which will list all folders and pictures :

 * \{\{ url \}\} : The current url
 * \{\{ breadcrumb \}\} : An hash containing a splitted array of URL. Keys are URL and values are folders name
 * \{\{ folders \}\} : An array containing folder objects for current url. Each folder has 3 attributes (url, thumbnail_url, name)
 * \{\{ images \}\} : An array containing image objects for current url. Each image has 3 attributes (url, thumbnail_url, name)
 * \{\{ page_count \}\} : The total count of pages for current url.
 * \{\{ current_page \}\} : The current page

Variables for `detail.html`, which will display one picture :

* \{\{ breadcrumb \}\} : An hash containing a splitted array of URL. Keys are URL and values are folders name
* \{\{ image_url \}\} : The URL of the current image
* \{\{ image_previous_url \}\} : The URL of the previous image
* \{\{ image_next_url \}\} : The URL of the next image

Variables for `login.html`, which will display the login form :

 * \{\{ login_error \}\} : Tell if login attempt was valid or not
 * \{\{ username \}\} : The username entered in login form input


## Thumbnail generation

For easy thumbnail generation in your theme, there is an helper function available in your views.
You should use the function `picturo_thumbnail` in your views.

For example, if you want to generate a squared 300px by 300px thumbnail, insert the following line in your view :

{% raw %}
```
{% picturo_thumbnail(thumbnail_url, 300, 300) %}
```
{% endraw %}

Thumbnail will be be automagically created in a folder matching the size of the thumbnail !

### Other themes

I plan to release some others theme later, but if your want to create your own I recommend to check the `default` theme and use [Twig template](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html#template-inheritance) for easy theming.

And please, show me your theme if you want to share it.
