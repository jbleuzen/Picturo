====

Picturo is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file photo gallery. 

[Documentation](http://jbleuzen.github.io/Picturo/) â€” [Demo](http://picturo.johanbleuzen.fr) (user : admin - pass : admin)

If you have trouble with Picturo, please use the [Issue page](https://github.com/jbleuzen/Picturo/issues).

TODO :

My changes compared to Johan version :
 * Better authentification method
 * Add ban functions to avoid spam (writen by Seb Sauvage at sebsauvage.net)
 * Add administrator status
 * Add multiple users
 * Add possibility to hide folders to users via administration. By default, a new folder is available for all users.
 * Administrator can manage pictures (rotate, cropped, cut, reduce, setWidth, setHeight). Modifications are made on thumbnails. Originals are not modified.
 * Add error view
 * Update theme (footer is always at the bottom of the page -not bottom of the screen- whatever the height of content)
 * Pictures (originals) can be download one by one by users
 * javascript preloader for big pictures
 * generate method of thumbnail replace by auto_thumb method (writen by Bronco at warriordudimanche.net)
 * pictures and folders are sorting with natural case insensitive sort
